/*
You have the hypotenuse and the angle 
And youâ€™re trying to figure out the lengths of the other two sides 
So you can use sin and cos to figure out the x and y offset from the center of the circle 
Sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse 
Solve for opposite (which will be the y offset)
Cos(angle) = adjacent / hypotenuse 
Solve for adjacent which will be the x offset

For a circle with origin (j, k) and radius r:

x(t) = r cos(t) + j
y(t) = r sin(t) + k

where you need to run this equation for t taking values within
 the range from 0 to 360, then you will get your x and y each on the boundary of the circle.
