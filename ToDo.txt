Weasley Clock App

  * Written Description
  The goal for this project is to recreate the 'Weasley Clock' from the Harry Potter series.  This magical grandfather clock tells people's
  location/status instead of time and is used by the Weasley Family to keep track of the peopel they care about.  Options on the clock include
  things like 'work', 'school', 'travel', or even 'mortal peril'.  The goal of this app is to provide a similar service - the user can update
  their location and add a status note.  For example say a user who is at home on a Thursday evening may have a different status if they are
  up for dinner/drinks vs preparing for an important presentation Friday morning.  The goal for the app is to be fun, easy to use,
  aesthetically appealing - you want users to enjoy interacting with the app so they will want to update their location/status.

  * Financial Notes
    - Could be adware but not ideal as that would take away from overall user experience
    - Can recieve revenue for sending users to Uber/Lyft/Yelp/OpenTable?
    - Keep overhead low by focusing on app being as lightweight as possible, leverage functionality of larger orgs (e.g. FB Auth)

    - React-Native for mobile app
    - Express for Server
    - Mongo, love of my life, for DB
    


  Notes
  - Location + Status '@ home, come on over' '@ home enjoying me time'
  - What about security? Should you be able to search all users? Maybe no search and person has to give you their username? Maybe Facebook
    Auth so you can see your FB friends? Basically outsource security to them?
  
  - Do custom locations show up on friends clocks
    - Only standard locations
