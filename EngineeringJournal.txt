* Wanted to be deliberate about app design so wanted to fully visualize the app before jumping into coding.
  Started by making an app plan - description, customer stories, basic requirements, revenue streams.
* Since app was location based, mobile made sense to decided to use React-Native
* Next step was to work on front-end render
  * Next step was to determine which pages/components need to be created and draw visuals
* MAJOR QUESTION - should this be web or mobile - mobile has advantages, can use phone gps to update location - makes it easier
use in multiple places vs web is mainly available on laptop.  mobile disadvantages is that this is supposed to look cool and be
fun to play with so it is way easier to do that on web than mobile.  Challenge was that if it is mostly used on web how to have
people have status updates other than 'at home'.  Want to encourage people to post what they are going to do 'I'm about to leave work'
'at home - heading to the gym soon'.  Can still have eventual mobile app to facilitate mobile updates but similar model to facebook.
Web app is most important and mobile is a nice addition.  Yes that could differ with different grups of people and in many countries
monbile is main experience but that is outside the scope of this project.
